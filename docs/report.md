2. Update shopify.app.toml with actual Shopify app credentials
3. Create production-ready env.example template

🔴 2. Production Configuration

# shopify.app.toml needs real values:

client_id = "your_client_id_here" # ❌ Placeholder
dev_store_url = "testratultoto.myshopify.com" # ❌ Dev reference

🔴 3. Environment Variables

# Current .env has exposed credentials:

SHOPIFY_API_KEY=5290429c9058572f1d88772672bc8e36 # ❌ Should not be in
repo
REDIRECT_URI=https://9c5bfa084d4c.ngrok-free.app # ❌ Development URL
